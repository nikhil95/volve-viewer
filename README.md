VolView is a medical image viewer for the web!
Built on [vtk.js](https://github.com/Kitware/vtk-js) and [itk.js](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-js/), it is a self-contained single-page web application with the following features:

- DICOM loading: load your studies and series directly into the app! No PACS needed
- DICOM browsing: browse your DICOM data in a a quick patient-study-series view
- Annotations (WIP): support for 2D paint and measurements
- Volume rendering: Support for changing of colormaps and opacities
- Models: Load in geometry and view them in 2D or 3D
- ...and more to come!

This project is still a work in progress, so suggestions and contributions are welcome in the issue tracker!
